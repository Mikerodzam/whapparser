# Ordered backlog

# TODO  
1. in the category view I need to see charts per year and per category  
    - a line chart showing IN/OUT from month to month  
    - on click on a category, display a line chart showing expenses for that cagegory from month to month  
2. a dashboard to check Current-Year + Year-over-Year statistics, probably charts  
3. deploy and run from aws  
    - this means I need to implement some kind of security features  
4. in the monthly view I need a way to add new expenses
5. refactor for code reusability, design patterns/code cleanness - make code easily testable  
6. implement tests  
    - unit tests for logic  
    - integration tests for db repos  
    - consider test database  

# DONE
